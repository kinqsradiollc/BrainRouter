# BrainRouter — Deep Docs

The top-level files ([README](../README.md), [BRAINROUTER](../BRAINROUTER.md),
[PRESENTATION](../PRESENTATION.md)) stay short on purpose. This folder has the
deep dives.

- **[memory-engine.md](memory-engine.md)** — the 4-layer stack, forgetting
  curve, ACE reinforcement loop, recall pipeline (FTS5 + vector + filepath
  → RRF → priority blend → rerank → relevance judge → graph), ranking
  blend, extraction robustness.
- **[cli.md](cli.md)** — the terminal agent: startup banner & statusline,
  `/where` and `/quiet`, tool loop, access modes, `/compact`, hookify
  rules, multi-agent orchestration, personality overlays, goal state
  machine, session isolation.
- **[configuration.md](configuration.md)** — env-loader priority chain
  (`$BRAINROUTER_ENV_FILE` → `~/.config/brainrouter/server.env` → `./.env`),
  `brainrouter-mcp init`, `~/.config/brainrouter/config.json` as the
  canonical CLI chat-LLM credential store, stdio vs HTTP transport,
  storage layout, backpressure, diagnostics.

If you're new, read [BRAINROUTER.md](../BRAINROUTER.md) first. If you just
want to run something, [README.md → Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start).
