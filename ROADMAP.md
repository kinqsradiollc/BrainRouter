## What Each Upcoming Release Means

> Shipped releases (0.3.x, 0.4.0, 0.4.1) live in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)
> and `brainrouter-changelog/`. This section only describes work that is
> still ahead.

### 0.4.3 — Memory depth (source chunks → tree) + CLI debugging & ops

Shipped so far: `/rewind --files` file restore, `/context` window-fill header,
the agent transcript debugger (`/agents tree` / `why` / `transcript` /
`replay`), the `source_documents` + `source_chunks` foundation, **token-aware
capture wired into the turn pipeline → batch-level provenance** (records cite
their source chunks; `memory_verify` returns excerpts) **→ `memory_fetch_source_chunk`
drill-down**, the **blackboard commit pipeline** (`memory_blackboard_review`),
**AST-aware code chunking**, a **governance dry-run** (`memory_governance_plan`),
**repair telemetry** + a **prompt-cache hit line** in `/context`, and the
**command-registry taxonomy guard**.

**Post feature-complete hardening (investigation batch):** cost-telemetry
`$0.00` fix (pricing **family-fallback** resolution + `inputCacheHit` NaN); the
**`/status` crash (#59)** + in-memory config self-heal (no read-time writes);
a **recall-quality overhaul** — correct security-intent detection, per-type
**priority caps** so never-decaying boilerplate can't out-rank fresh findings,
and a local **lexical-relevance + MMR-diversity** selection on the no-reranker
path (zero added latency); and **provenance-safe transcript retention**
(`memory_prune_sources`) with the `/sources` view hiding transcripts by default.

**Brain agents fully wired (BRAIN-P1 follow-through):** the six "idle · never"
depth agents now have real executors (on-demand via `memory_agent_run`) — vault
export, blackboard reconcile+commit, tree seal, source re-chunk, and a
self-retrieval `benchmark_eval`, and `tree_digest` (LLM re-summary of tree
parents, **auto-chained off tree_sealer**). A throttled maintenance pass on the
job runner auto-schedules vault export, blackboard reconcile, and `tree_sealer`
(fed by a **scene-tree autobuild over cognitive records**). With `tree_digest`
in, **every Brain Agent has a real executor** — the tree flow runs on its own:
scene-leaf → seal → LLM re-summary.

**CLI — full set**

- **Background & detachment ✓:** `/bg <prompt>` runs a detached background
  worker (reuses the proven worker-thread infra; managed via `/workers` + `/ps`).
  *(Detaching an already-in-flight foreground turn is a deeper turn-loop change.)*
- **Debugging & explainability ✓:** `/context memory` decision view (planned →
  used → skipped sources + injected records); `/context prefix` component-drift
  view (system / memory-anchor; tool-list capture later); repair telemetry
  (scavenged / truncation / storm counts in `/context`).
- **Cost ✓:** opt-in `cost` status segment (turn USD + cache-hit %) + a
  `/context` prompt-cache hit-ratio line.
- **Headless ✓:** `brainrouter run --format jsonl` — a versioned, stable
  per-event stream (turn_start / status / tool / child / text / turn_end+cost /
  error) for CI and external orchestrators.
- **Safety ✓:** unified `decideExecutionPolicy` module; the `run_command` shell
  gate routes through it. *(file-edit / child / network routing later.)*
- **Verification ✓:** `/verify detect` (project profile + recipe) and `/verify
  run` (executes build/test/lint). *(post-edit LSP diagnostics needs live servers.)*
- **Ergonomics ✓:** command-registry taxonomy guard; `/context offloads`;
  grouped `/inbox` + `--watch` + inline handoff-accept; `/agents create`
  (validate → write). *(interactive create wizard = optional follow-up.)*
- **Packaging (after 0.4.3 stabilizes):** shell completions, Homebrew tap,
  one-line installer.

**Brain-side memory — full set** *(depth before breadth)*

- **Source layer ✓:** `source_documents` + `source_chunks` tables + store.
- **Token-aware capture ✓:** chunk sources on every turn; extracted records
  cite their source-chunk ids; `memory_verify` returns source excerpts.
  *(Batch-level provenance; per-record attribution refines later.)*
- **Blackboard commit pipeline ✓:** stage extraction candidates → reconcile /
  conflict-check → commit to cognitive records with an audit trail.
  *(Pipeline + `memory_blackboard_review` tool; live-extraction rerouting later.)*
- **Memory tree ✓:** durable source/topic/global summary hierarchy (append leaf
  → seal bucket → summarize parent → walk/drill via `memory_tree_walk`), generic
  mechanics in `tree/tree.ts` kept separate from policy. *(deterministic +
  LLM re-summary (`tree_digest`) and scene-autobuild now wired; source/topic/
  global policy split → 0.4.4.)*
- **AST-aware code chunking ✓** (TS/JS/Python/Rust, line-based fallback) and a
  read-only **vault mirror ✓** (`memory_vault_export` — markdown + hash ledger,
  idempotent, redacted; DB authoritative).
- **Recall drill-down ✓:** `memory_fetch_source_chunk` (full chunk + parent doc
  + neighbours) **and** `memory_tree_walk` (walk roots / drill a node).
- **Retrieval benchmark harness:** one command, fixed datasets, FTS / hybrid /
  rerank / tree / AST modes, JSON + markdown summary, regression thresholds,
  CI-friendly.
- **Brain jobs:** new kinds for chunking, blackboard reconcile, tree
  seal/digest, vault export, and benchmark eval.
- **Governance & hygiene:** a governance dry-run ✓ (`memory_governance_plan` —
  preview what would archive/delete by filter); an offload reclaimer (retention
  + orphan cleanup); uniform redaction ✓ across source chunks, blackboard
  candidates, offload previews, and vault exports.

Cross-cutting ✓: every new table carries `user_id` + `workspace_tag` scope
columns so team/RBAC can arrive later without migration; 0.4.3 stays
local-first (columns NULL until federation populates them). Carried infra:
git-worktree session isolation.

### 0.4.4 — Memory pipeline tightening + unified trust

0.4.3 shipped the memory *depth primitives* and wired every brain agent. 0.4.4
makes them **precise and unavoidable** rather than available-but-optional —
the theme is *tighten, don't invent*. (The CLI multi-agent + parity feature
bar this builds on top of shipped across 0.4.0–0.4.2.)

- **Exact chunk-level provenance.** Replace batch-level record→chunk linking
  with per-candidate chunk ids/spans, surfaced in `memory_verify` + recall.
- **Blackboard-default admission.** Route extraction candidates *through* the
  blackboard (stage → reconcile/conflict-check → commit) instead of writing
  cognitive records directly — staged, audited memory by default.
- **Recall expansion refs inline.** Every compact recall hit carries
  source-chunk / tree-node / provenance handles so a client can drill down
  without a second blind query.
- **Parser-backed code chunking.** Swap the heuristic regex chunker for a
  tree-sitter/LSP adapter (TS/JS/Python/Rust) with a line-based fallback, and
  benchmark code recall against the heuristic baseline.
- **Benchmark honesty.** Add the advertised-but-missing tree/AST (and
  rerank/judge) modes to the retrieval harness; publish numbers; make the
  strict summary a release gate.
- **Tree policy split.** Separate generic tree mechanics from source/topic/
  global domain policy; document + schedule the three domains.
- **Unified exec policy.** Route file-write / edit / apply_patch / child-spawn
  / background / network through the one `decideExecutionPolicy` surface (only
  the shell tool does today), with approval audit events.
- **Governance & retention (P2):** extend the governance dry-run to source
  chunks / tree nodes / vault exports / offloads; add an offload reclaimer;
  broaden redaction regression fixtures.
- **CLI ergonomics:** `/reload-skills`; optional carried follow-ups
  (interactive `/agents create` wizard, in-flight `/bg` detach, post-edit LSP
  diagnostics) ride along if capacity allows.

### 0.5.0 — Power User Surface

- Fullscreen `/focus` TUI.
- Plugin marketplace and trust/signature model.
- Cross-harness handoff UX on top of federation.
- **Brain-side Phase 6:** engineering sync providers (Git, GitHub, local docs,
  terminal logs) and proactive situation reports. Tasks: `BRAIN-P6-TN`.

### CLI Parity (rolling — 0.4.2 → 0.5.0)

Bringing the CLI up to the leading agentic-CLI feature bar. Grouped by
area; each item lands in the version noted.

- **Workflows & orchestration (0.4.2 — shipped).** Durable workflow run
  engine (per-step `run.json` ledger); a `/workflows` viewer showing live run
  status + step timeline (not just artifact folders); and above-prompt
  notifications when a background run finishes while you're idle.
- **Review & quality (0.4.2 — shipped).** `/review --fix` applies + verifies
  the surviving findings; first-class `/simplify` (behavior-preserving
  cleanup).
- **Effort & model (0.4.2 — shipped).** `/effort xhigh` (alias `max`);
  `/model --session` (this-session-only switch); `cli.fallbackModel` runtime
  fallback on model-not-found.
- **Timeline & context (0.4.2 — shipped).** `/rewind` to fork from an earlier
  turn; `/context` token breakdown (per-skill / per-tool / per-briefing).
- **Background & shell UX (0.4.2 shipped `!`; `/bg` → 0.4.3).** The `!` shell
  escape from the composer shipped in 0.4.2; `/bg` (push the in-flight
  response to the background) needs turn-detachment infra and moves to 0.4.3.
- **Extensibility polish (0.5.0).** `/reload-skills`; `disallowed-tools` in
  skill/command frontmatter; a message-display hook; first-use approval for
  third-party MCP servers; and real modal vim editing in the composer.

*Out of scope:* remote control / mobile push and first-party browser
control (would arrive only via an external MCP server, not core).
