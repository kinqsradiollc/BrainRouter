## What Each Upcoming Release Means

> Shipped releases (0.3.x, 0.4.0, 0.4.1) live in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)
> and `brainrouter-changelog/`. This section only describes work that is
> still ahead.

### 0.4.3 — Memory depth (source chunks → tree) + CLI debugging & ops

Shipped so far: `/rewind --files` file restore, `/context` window-fill header,
the agent transcript debugger (`/agents tree` / `why` / `transcript` /
`replay`), the `source_documents` + `source_chunks` foundation, **token-aware
capture wired into the turn pipeline → batch-level provenance** (records cite
their source chunks; `memory_verify` returns excerpts) **→ `memory_fetch_source_chunk`
drill-down**, the **blackboard commit pipeline** (`memory_blackboard_review`),
**AST-aware code chunking**, a **governance dry-run** (`memory_governance_plan`),
**repair telemetry** + a **prompt-cache hit line** in `/context`, and the
**command-registry taxonomy guard**.

**CLI — full set**

- **Background & detachment:** `/bg` — detach the in-flight turn (persist a run
  id, stream logs to the transcript; `/fg`, `/ps`, `/stop`, completion notice).
- **Debugging & explainability:** `/context prefix` drift labels (pinned hash,
  changed region, tool-list / memory-anchor delta, last cache-miss cause); a
  memory-decision view (which prompt regions were stable, which memories were
  injected vs skipped, and why); repair telemetry ✓ (scavenged / truncation /
  storm counts, surfaced in `/context`).
- **Cost ✓:** opt-in `cost` status segment (turn USD + cache-hit %) + a
  `/context` prompt-cache hit-ratio line. *(offloaded/child fields can extend it.)*
- **Headless ✓:** `brainrouter run --format jsonl` — a versioned, stable
  per-event stream (turn_start / status / tool / child / text / turn_end+cost /
  error) for CI and external orchestrators.
- **Safety:** a unified execution-policy module — one allow/ask/deny (+ reason)
  behind shell, file edits, child writes, network, and `/bg`.
- **Verification:** `/verify detect` recipe cache (Node/Python/Rust/web) +
  post-edit language diagnostics after write/edit/apply_patch.
- **Ergonomics:** command-registry cleanup ✓ (help + palette in lockstep, no
  duplicate rows, taxonomy guard; filterable "workflow mode" palettes next);
  `/agents create` / `/pack create` wizard; a `/context offloads` browser;
  inline handoff-accept + `/inbox --watch`.
- **Packaging (after 0.4.3 stabilizes):** shell completions, Homebrew tap,
  one-line installer.

**Brain-side memory — full set** *(depth before breadth)*

- **Source layer ✓:** `source_documents` + `source_chunks` tables + store.
- **Token-aware capture ✓:** chunk sources on every turn; extracted records
  cite their source-chunk ids; `memory_verify` returns source excerpts.
  *(Batch-level provenance; per-record attribution refines later.)*
- **Blackboard commit pipeline ✓:** stage extraction candidates → reconcile /
  conflict-check → commit to cognitive records with an audit trail.
  *(Pipeline + `memory_blackboard_review` tool; live-extraction rerouting later.)*
- **Memory tree ✓:** durable source/topic/global summary hierarchy (append leaf
  → seal bucket → summarize parent → walk/drill via `memory_tree_walk`), generic
  mechanics in `tree/tree.ts` kept separate from policy. *(deterministic
  summarizer; LLM summaries + auto-build later.)*
- **AST-aware code chunking ✓** (TS/JS/Python/Rust, line-based fallback) and a
  read-only **vault mirror ✓** (`memory_vault_export` — markdown + hash ledger,
  idempotent, redacted; DB authoritative).
- **Recall drill-down ✓:** `memory_fetch_source_chunk` (full chunk + parent doc
  + neighbours) **and** `memory_tree_walk` (walk roots / drill a node).
- **Retrieval benchmark harness:** one command, fixed datasets, FTS / hybrid /
  rerank / tree / AST modes, JSON + markdown summary, regression thresholds,
  CI-friendly.
- **Brain jobs:** new kinds for chunking, blackboard reconcile, tree
  seal/digest, vault export, and benchmark eval.
- **Governance & hygiene:** a governance dry-run ✓ (`memory_governance_plan` —
  preview what would archive/delete by filter); an offload reclaimer (retention
  + orphan cleanup); uniform redaction ✓ across source chunks, blackboard
  candidates, offload previews, and vault exports.

Cross-cutting ✓: every new table carries `user_id` + `workspace_tag` scope
columns so team/RBAC can arrive later without migration; 0.4.3 stays
local-first (columns NULL until federation populates them). Carried infra:
git-worktree session isolation.

### 0.5.0 — Power User Surface

- Fullscreen `/focus` TUI.
- Plugin marketplace and trust/signature model.
- Cross-harness handoff UX on top of federation.
- **Brain-side Phase 6:** engineering sync providers (Git, GitHub, local docs,
  terminal logs) and proactive situation reports. Tasks: `BRAIN-P6-TN`.

### CLI Parity (rolling — 0.4.2 → 0.5.0)

Bringing the CLI up to the leading agentic-CLI feature bar. Grouped by
area; each item lands in the version noted.

- **Workflows & orchestration (0.4.2 — shipped).** Durable workflow run
  engine (per-step `run.json` ledger); a `/workflows` viewer showing live run
  status + step timeline (not just artifact folders); and above-prompt
  notifications when a background run finishes while you're idle.
- **Review & quality (0.4.2 — shipped).** `/review --fix` applies + verifies
  the surviving findings; first-class `/simplify` (behavior-preserving
  cleanup).
- **Effort & model (0.4.2 — shipped).** `/effort xhigh` (alias `max`);
  `/model --session` (this-session-only switch); `cli.fallbackModel` runtime
  fallback on model-not-found.
- **Timeline & context (0.4.2 — shipped).** `/rewind` to fork from an earlier
  turn; `/context` token breakdown (per-skill / per-tool / per-briefing).
- **Background & shell UX (0.4.2 shipped `!`; `/bg` → 0.4.3).** The `!` shell
  escape from the composer shipped in 0.4.2; `/bg` (push the in-flight
  response to the background) needs turn-detachment infra and moves to 0.4.3.
- **Extensibility polish (0.5.0).** `/reload-skills`; `disallowed-tools` in
  skill/command frontmatter; a message-display hook; first-use approval for
  third-party MCP servers; and real modal vim editing in the composer.

*Out of scope:* remote control / mobile push and first-party browser
control (would arrive only via an external MCP server, not core).
