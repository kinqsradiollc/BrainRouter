# BrainRouter Agent Context Router

**AGENT INSTRUCTION:** This is your primary navigation hub for working on the BrainRouter project itself. Do NOT scan the entire directory. Instead, identify the user's task below and load ONLY the specified Global Skill via `mcp_brainrouter_get_skill`, the reference via `mcp_brainrouter_get_reference`, or the listed local documentation file to minimize context noise.

## ⚖️ Core Rules

- **Memory-First Habit**: Before doing anything, you MUST call `mcp_brainrouter_resolve_session` passing the current workspace path and the **Conversation ID** (as the `suggestedKey` if present). Use the returned `sessionKey` UUID for all subsequent `recall`, `capture_turn`, and `search` operations.
- **Short-Term Working Memory Offloads**: Proactively call `mcp_brainrouter_memory_working_offload` for any stdout, stderr, or files exceeding **1,000 tokens** to prevent context window bloat. Use `mcp_brainrouter_memory_working_context` to monitor the Mermaid task canvas.
- **Proactive Memory Retrieval**: If `memory_recall` returns insufficient context, you MUST call `mcp_brainrouter_memory_search` with specific keywords. Use the optional `asOf` parameter (ISO 8601) to query what the memory engine knew at a specific point in time.
- **Citation Habit**: After generating your response, call `mcp_brainrouter_memory_mark_cited` with the `recordIds` you actually referenced (`citedRecordIds`) and the full list returned by the previous recall (`allRecalledRecordIds`). This powers the ACE feedback loop. Pass an empty `citedRecordIds` array if no memories were used.
- **Skill Context Registration**: When loading or updating a skill, proactively call `mcp_brainrouter_memory_register_skill_hints` to ensure the memory engine knows what to extract.
- **Resolve Contradictions**: Periodically, especially when starting a new task, call `mcp_brainrouter_memory_contradictions` to check for and resolve any conflicting instructions or memories.
- **No Shortcuts**: Avoid "this is too small for a skill" or "I'll just quickly fix it" rationalization.

## 🔄 Execution Model

For every request:
1. **Resolve Session**: Proactively call `mcp_brainrouter_resolve_session` with your current workspace path and the **Conversation ID** (as `suggestedKey`) to get a standardized `sessionKey` UUID.
2. **Recall Context**: Call `mcp_brainrouter_memory_recall` using the resolved `sessionKey`. If in a long-running task, also fetch `mcp_brainrouter_memory_working_context` to view the task canvas. Capture the `recalledL1Memories[].recordId` list — you will need it in step 6.
3. **Detect Intent**: Map the user's request to a scenario below using the recalled context. Check `mcp_brainrouter_memory_contradictions` if there is ambiguity.
4. **Select Skill**: Identify the most relevant skill name.
5. **Execute & Offload**: Fetch the skill using `mcp_brainrouter_get_skill`. If this is a newly invoked skill, call `mcp_brainrouter_memory_register_skill_hints`. Follow the skill workflow strictly. Call `mcp_brainrouter_memory_working_offload` for any output exceeding 1,000 tokens.
6. **Signal Citations**: After generating your response, call `mcp_brainrouter_memory_mark_cited` with:
   - `citedRecordIds`: IDs of memories you actually referenced in your response
   - `allRecalledRecordIds`: the full `recalledL1Memories[].recordId` list from step 2
   - Pass an empty `citedRecordIds: []` if no specific memories were used
7. **Record Outcome**: If passive capturing hooks (e.g. Claude Code/Codex) are not running, call `mcp_brainrouter_memory_capture_turn` using the resolved `sessionKey` as your *final tool call* to persist the turn.
8. **Iterate**: Return to this router if the scenario changes (e.g., from Debugging to Shipping).

## 🏗️ Scenario: MCP Server Development
*Focus: Tools, registry, loaders, and stdio/HTTP transports.*

## 🎭 Orchestration: Skills, Personas, and Commands
BrainRouter uses three composable layers to manage complexity:

- **Skills** (Global MCP): Workflows with steps and exit criteria. The **How**.
- **Personas** (Global MCP): Roles with a specific perspective (e.g., Security Auditor). The **Who**.
- **Commands**: User-facing entry points (e.g., `/review`). The **When**.

**Composition Rule:** Personas do not invoke other personas. A persona may invoke global skills using `mcp_brainrouter_get_skill`.

### 🔀 Persona Decision Matrix
- **Invoke `code-reviewer`**: When conducting PR reviews (Correctness, Readability, Architecture, Security, Performance).
- **Invoke `security-auditor`**: When auditing sensitive flows or threat modeling new features.
- **Invoke `test-engineer`**: When defining test strategies or resolving QA gaps.

---

**QUICK LOAD COMMAND:**
Look up the required resource name for your scenario, then use the appropriate tool to load the instructions:
- **Skills**: `mcp_brainrouter_get_skill(name: "<skill-name>")`
- **References**: `mcp_brainrouter_get_reference(name: "<reference-name>")`
- **Personas**: `mcp_brainrouter_get_persona(name: "<persona-name>")`
- **Docs (Templates)**: `mcp_brainrouter_get_doc(name: "<doc-name>")`
- **Memory Tools — RAG / Long-Term**:
  - `memory_recall` → inject context at turn start (returns `recalledL1Memories[].recordId`)
  - `memory_mark_cited` → signal citations after response (required — drives ACE loop)
  - `memory_capture_turn` → persist turn as final tool call (optional if passive hooks active)
  - `memory_search` → deep retrieval (supports `asOf` ISO param for point-in-time)
  - `memory_contradictions` → surface + resolve conflicting instructions
- **Memory Tools — Working Memory / Context Reduction**:
  - `memory_working_context` → fetch Mermaid task canvas & state block
  - `memory_working_offload` → offload large payloads (>1,000 tokens), return nodeId
  - `memory_working_reset` → flush working memory for session
- **Memory Tools — Software Engineering Workflow**:
  - `memory_task_state` / `_update` → structured progress tracking
  - `memory_failed_attempts` → query previously failed solutions
  - `memory_file_history` → query memories tied to specific file paths
  - `memory_debug_trace_save` / `_search` → record/query reproduction traces for bugs
  - `memory_handover` → produce handover summary with evidence links
  - `memory_verify` → verify memory and adjust confidence score
